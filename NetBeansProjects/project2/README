# Traveling Booking System

## Description
This is a GUI-based Java project developed as part of OOP2 course. 
It builds on the first project and focuses on travel ticket booking (bus, train, flight) with database integration for persistent storage.

The project demonstrates OOP, GUI, and Database concepts for a real-world application, with code organized in packages for maintainability.

## Features

### 1. User Roles & Authentication
- Dual login interfaces: Passengers and Admins
