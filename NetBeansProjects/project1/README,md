# Online Ticket Booking System

## Description
This is a console-based Java project created as part of OOP1 course. 
It provides a simple interactive ticket booking system for movies and travel events, allowing users to explore OOP concepts practically.

### Proposal Overview
Our system allows users to browse a wide range of events and travel options (movies, concerts, sports, buses, trains, and flights). Customers can choose events, handle seating and travel class options, and safely buy tickets.

## Features

### User Roles
- **Admin**
  - Fixed email/password in the code: OOPgroup3@iau.edu.sa / OOPgroup3@
  - Create, update, delete events (movies or travel)
  - Add tickets and set base prices
- **Customer**
  - Browse available events
  - Book tickets and view/cancel bookings
- **Guest**
  - Browse movies and travel options only (no booking)

### Event Management
- **Event**: base class for all events (name, location, date)
- **MovieEvent**: adds movie title, audience category (Kids/Adults)
- **TravelEvent**: adds destination and transport type (Bus, Train, Flight)

### Ticketing & Pricing
- **Ticket** (abstract class): links ticket to an event
- **StandardTicket**: base price $50 (movies +$5, travel ×1.3)
- **VIPTicket**: base price $100 (movies +$10, travel ×1.5)

### Validation & Security
- Password strength check using `checkPassword` method
- Input validation using `SimpleDateFormat`

## Notes
- Data stored temporarily in RAM using ArrayLists.
- Console-based interaction (Scanner input).
- Focused on practicing OOP concepts: Inheritance, Abstraction, Polymorphism.

## UML Diagrams
UML diagrams are in `digram/` folder.
