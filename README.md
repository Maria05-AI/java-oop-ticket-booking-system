# Java OOP Booking System (OOP1 & OOP2)

This repository contains a Java-based academic project developed across two Object-Oriented Programming courses.

## Project Evolution

### 1. OOP1 - Online Ticket Booking System (Project1) [Online Ticket Booking System](NetBeansProjects/project1/README.md)
- A console-based Java application for learning OOP concepts in a practical setting.
- Features multiple user roles: Admin, Customer, Guest.
- Supports booking for movies and travel events.
- Stores data temporarily in memory using ArrayLists.
- Focused on implementing core OOP principles: Inheritance, Abstraction, Polymorphism.
- Folder: `Project1/`
- UML diagrams included in `Project1/digram/`
  
### 2. OOP2 - Traveling Booking System (Project2)
- A GUI-based Java application for travel ticket booking (bus, train, flight).
- Multi-user system: Passengers and Admins with separate interfaces.
- Integrated with a database for persistent data storage.
- Implements OOP, GUI, and Database concepts for real-world application.
- Folder: `Project2/`
- Includes UML diagrams, Use Case, Mapping diagrams in `Project2/digram/`
- Overview PDF about the interface in `Project2/Overview about the interface/`

## Key Features in both
- Role-based system design
- Ticket booking and management
- Improved class relationships and modular design
- Input validation and error handling

## Technologies & Concepts
- Programming Language: Java
- Concepts:
  - Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
  - Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism
  - Class hierarchy design
- Tools: NetBeans

## Teamwork
This project was developed collaboratively as part of a university team project.
